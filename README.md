<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A vanilla JavaScript grid-based game made on the code template of <a href="https://github.com/kubowania/Nokia3310-Snake">Kubowania</a>.<br/>
This game is a remaster of the classic snake game played on a 30x30 grid (900 squares), featuring increased speed to enhance difficulty. <br/>
I have also added a leaderboard to save and compare the highest scores achieved.
